WINDOWS USERS

OpenMortal comes with this friendly installer now. Run it, K? :)

LINUX/BSD/MAC OS USERS

So, here's this configure script, right? Yes. Depending on which
version you downloaded it installs the "base" system with all the
characters, or just some characters.

First command to run is:

    autoreconf -i

If you got the master package, you can choose to disable some of
the characters with parameters to configure:

  --enable-main           Include main data and binary [default: yes]
  --enable-characters     Include the first batch of characters [default: yes]
  --enable-additional     Include the second batch of characters [default: yes]
  --enable-thirdparty     Include the 3rd party characters [default: yes]

This is intended to help packagers break the master package into smaller
chunks.

To get the entire list of (mostly useless) configure options, call

   ./configure -help

After configure does it's magic, you go

   make
   make install
   openmortal

Developer packages for Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and its derivates:

apt install -y libperl-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev libfreetype-dev

What to do in case something goes wrong during installation:

   1. Curse me.
   2. Make sure that perl-devel, SDL-devel, SDL_image-devel, SDL_mixer-devel and
      freetype2-devel
   3. Check OpenMortal Bugs tracker on the website.
   4. File new bug report if no solution is found.
