Packagers, please read this!

If you wish to package/redistribute OpenMortal for a specific distribution,
PLEASE LET ME KNOW so I can contact you in case there is a security update,
or new version for OpenMortal.

OpenMortal can be split into sub-packages to reduce download size. Do
"./configure -help" for details.

Also I would like to thank all the people who helped bring OpenMortal to
Gentoo, Mandrake, Sorcerer, UHU, MacOS X, NetBSD, and any others that I
haven't notices.

Cheers,
UPi.
