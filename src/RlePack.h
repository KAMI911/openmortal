/** 
\class CRlePack
\brief CRlePack is an array of images, compressed with runlength encoding.
\ingroup Media

OpenMortal stores the character graphics in CRlePack objects. The reason is 
simple: CRlePacks give an acceptable tradeoff between memory usage and 
blitting speed. Also the CRlePack allows the sprites to be draw horizontally 
flipped, thus saving memory (the mirrored version of the same sprite doesn't 
need to be stored).

The sprites in the RlePack are always paletted (8 bits per pixel). The size 
of the palette is between 1 and 256. The RlePack stores two copies of its 
palette: one is the "base" palette, as it was read from disk, the other is 
the "tinted" palette. The TintEnum contains values that can be passed to 
SetTint(). This is used for two things:

\li In case both players choose the same fighter, player 2's fighter is 
tinted so they won't get confused.
\li Some special effects (e.g. frozen) make the figther tinted as well.

CRlePack loads the sprites from a .DAT file in its constructor. If there is
an error (e.g. file doesn't exist), the number of sprites loaded will be 0.
CRlePack is usually used to store the many frames of a fighter in OpenMortal.
It is also used for the 'cast' in the CMainScreenDemo.

CRlePack doesn't concern itself with concepts such as "player" or "doodad", 
it merely stores the palette and sprites. This part of OpenMortal can be 
reused in any project with little changes.
