OpenMortal 0.4 README

OpenMortal is a spoof of the original Mortal Kombat fighting game. The
funny thing about OpenMortal is that you can play the game AS YOURSELF.
It takes some work, but if you follow the Character Creation-HOWTO at

http://openmortal.sourceforge.net/Character_HOWTO.html

OpenMortal is still under development. The most important missing
features are:
* There is no support single player game.
* Throws are missing.
* Most of the projectiles aren't implemented yet.

Other planned features:
* Network play.
* Downloadable characters.

For further details, see the project's bug and feature request databases.

PACKAGERS:

It is possible to split OpenMortal into sub-packages, separating characters
from the base package, and thus reduce download times.
